## Prompt Description

[Briefly describe the purpose of the prompt and the context in which it is intended to be used, especially in the context of artificial annotation with generative models.]

## Prompt Text

Content moderation, as described above, can be linked to various other topics, such as health, crime, or equality.
For each tweet in the sample, follow these instructions:<br>
1. Carefully read the text of the tweet, paying close attention to details. 2. Classify the tweet into one of the topics defined below.<br>

* HEALTH AND SAFETY: Health care access and effectiveness, illness, disease, sanitation, obesity, mental health effects, prevention of or perpetuation of gun violence, infrastructure and building safety.<br>
* QUALITY OF LIFE: The effects of a policy on individuals’ wealth, mobility, access to resources, happiness, social structures, ease of day-to-day routines, quality of community life, etc.<br>
* CULTURAL IDENTITY: The social norms, trends, values and customs constituting culture(s), as they relate to a specific policy issue.<br>
* PUBLIC OPINION: References to general social attitudes, polling and demographic information, as well as implied or actual consequences of diverging from or “getting ahead of” public opinion or polls.<br>
* POLITICAL: Any political considerations surrounding an issue. Issue actions or efforts or stances that are political, such as partisan filibusters, lobbyist involvement, bipartisan efforts, deal-making and vote trading, appealing to one’s base, mentions of political maneuvering. Explicit statements that a policy issue is good or bad for a particular political party.<br>
* EXTERNAL REGULATION AND REPUTATION: The United States’ external relations with another nation; the external relations of one state with another; or relations between groups. This includes trade agreements and outcomes, comparisons of policy outcomes or desired policy outcomes.<br>
