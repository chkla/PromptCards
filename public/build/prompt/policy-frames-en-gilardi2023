          <h2>Prompt Description</h2>
<p>[Briefly describe the purpose of the prompt and the context in which it is intended to be used, especially in the context of artificial annotation with generative models.]</p>
<h2>Prompt Text</h2>
<p>Content moderation, as described above, can be linked to various other topics, such as health, crime, or equality.
For each tweet in the sample, follow these instructions:<br>
1. Carefully read the text of the tweet, paying close attention to details. 2. Classify the tweet into one of the topics defined below.<br>
<br>
The topics are defined as follows:<br>

* CONSTITUTIONALITY AND JURISPRUDENCE: The constraints imposed on or freedoms granted to individuals, government, and corporations via the Constitution, Bill of Rights and other amendments, or judicial interpretation. This deals specifically with the authority of government to regulate, and the authority of in- dividuals/corporations to act independently of government.<br>
* POLICY PRESCRIPTION AND EVALUATION: Particular policies proposed for addressing an identified problem, and figuring out if certain policies will work, or if existing policies are effective.<br>

* HEALTH AND SAFETY: Health care access and effectiveness, illness, disease, sanitation, obesity, mental health effects, prevention of or perpetuation of gun violence, infrastructure and building safety.<br>
* QUALITY OF LIFE: The effects of a policy on individuals’ wealth, mobility, access to resources, happiness, social structures, ease of day-to-day routines, quality of community life, etc.<br>
* CULTURAL IDENTITY: The social norms, trends, values and customs constituting culture(s), as they relate to a specific policy issue.<br>
* PUBLIC OPINION: References to general social attitudes, polling and demographic information, as well as implied or actual consequences of diverging from or “getting ahead of” public opinion or polls.<br>
* POLITICAL: Any political considerations surrounding an issue. Issue actions or efforts or stances that are political, such as partisan filibusters, lobbyist involvement, bipartisan efforts, deal-making and vote trading, appealing to one’s base, mentions of political maneuvering. Explicit statements that a policy issue is good or bad for a particular political party.<br>
* EXTERNAL REGULATION AND REPUTATION: The United States’ external relations with another nation; the external relations of one state with another; or relations between groups. This includes trade agreements and outcomes, comparisons of policy outcomes or desired policy outcomes.<br>
* OTHER: Any topic that does not fit into the above categories.<br></p>
