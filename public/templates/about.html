      <h1>About Prompt Archive</h1>
      <p>
        Prompt Archive is a repository of prompts used in research projects for artificial annotation. The archive aims to provide an easily accessible and searchable platform for researchers and developers working with Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The prompts are presented in a clean, minimalistic layout with prompt cards that provide detailed information about the author, date, language, NLP task, prompt text, research paper, and any additional comments. Users can search and filter prompts by language and task, making it easier to find relevant prompts for their projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        The archive is constantly growing as new prompts are contributed by the community. If you have a prompt that you would like to share, please consider uploading it to the archive.
